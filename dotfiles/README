We observe that the experienced nerd often prefers tools which afford a measure
of customization, and that most hackers accrue some amount of configuration for
editors, shells, IRC clients, and the like.

In this directory, please include (at your option) either:

  a) A collection of dotfiles or other configuration from your working
     environment.

     Dotfiles have been prefixed for easier access. These are not comprehensive, 
     just a small scattering of the random configs I end up making when working 
     on projects. :)


  b) A rationale for your lack of same.  Responses will be evaluated for
     both style and content.
