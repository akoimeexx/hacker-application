Please answer the following administrative/personal questions:

1. What is your desired compensation range?

   Immediately, pending relocation compensation.


3. Do you have any planned vacations/absences in the next
   six months that we should know about?

   None whatsoever.


4. Do you have any problem with dogs?

   I love dogs, used to have a Black Lab/Dalmation mix named Chance.


5. Please describe one of the greatest costumes you've ever attempted,
   Halloween or otherwise.

   The Joker, for Halloween. I do a half-decent impression of 
   Heath Ledger's Joker voice.


6. What are some of your favorite webcomics, if any?

   This is not an exhaustive list, but in no particular order, OotS, 
   LFG, Dominic Deegan, Goblins, Manly Guys Doing Manly Things,

7. If you could have one Inspector-Gadget-style bionic attachment, what
   would it be and what would you do with it?

   Gotta go with helicopter props. I'd love to be able to fly, even if I looked like I had an oversized beanie hat on my head.


8. If you learned the zombie apocalypse was going to erupt tomorrow, what
   would you do today?

   Take over the building I have picked out for fortification. It's an abandoned building that looks like a castle.
